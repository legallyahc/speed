## Montréal Métro Speedrunning

This is a website with information on the current rules and records for Métro (and REM) speedruns in Montréal, QC. Please submit a pull request (or an e-mail, or messsage) to add new records and attempts. Even if it isn't a new record, it's still cool to add to the history. Please link your website, if you have one!
