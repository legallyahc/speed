			<h1>Rules</h1>
			
			<h2>100% All Stations</h2>
			
			<p>This is the standard Montréal Métro speedrun category. The goal is to visit every station as fast as possible without splitting up a group (see <a href = "#co-op">Co-op</a>). This can be done just for the Montréal Métro, Réseau Express Métropolitain (REM), Métro+REM, and Métro+REM+Exo.</p> 
			
			<p><ul>
				<li>You must visit all station platforms.</li>
				<li style = "display: block;" class = "smaller">If you are on a train, you do not need to step off at every station so long as your train stops at every station.</li>
				<li>Time starts when the doors close on your first train, and end when doors open at your final station.</li>
				<li>Communal public transportation only.</li>
				<li style = "display: block;" class = "smaller">i.e. no cars, bikes, bixi, or taxis. Métro, REM, EXO, and buses only.</li>
				<li>This can be done in group so long as all members visit all stations together.</li>
				<li>You do not need to ensure your fare is valid for your entire trip (though <i>legally</i> you should).</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h2 id = "co-op">100% All Stations Co-op</h2>
			
			<p>This is a Métro speedrun with multiple teams. The goal is to split into separate teams that then cumulatively visit all stations.</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li style = "display: block; margin-left: -2em;">All Non-coop rules <strong>except:</strong></li>
				<li>All runners must begin and end at the same station.</li>
				<li>Runners do not need to visit all stations <em>together</em>.</li>
				<li>Time begins when the runners part at the origin station and time ends when all runners are together at the end station.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h2>+REM, +Exo</h2>
			<p><ul>
				<li style = "display: block; margin-left: -2em; margin-bottom: 0.2em;">An additional note for runs covering multiple modes:</li>
				<li>You must visit each station on each mode at that station.</li>
				<li style = "display: block;" class = "smaller">E.g. both the Métro and Exo platforms at Vendôme, both the Métro and REM platforms at McGill, or both the REM and Exo platforms at Côte-de-Liesse.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h1>Other cities!</h1>
			<p>There's a massive collection of other people who do this, too! While some of the most famous have a Guinness World Record, there are other 'home grown' collections like this. BART (San Francisco) <a href = "https://bart.gov/speedrun">collects records for their own system</a>, DC previously had a <a href = "https://web.archive.org/web/20161024235859/http://www.dcmetrochallenge.com/">similar blog about it</a>, and the <a href = "https://tris.fyi/speedrun/">MBTA (Boston) is also active</a>! If you can't find a local project, consider submitting to <a href = "https://transitruns.org">TransitRuns</a>.</p>

			<p>2025-11-17 changelog: Removed pausing rule due to general consensus and removed the only Métro 100% speedrun which used it (2021-03-01, the inaugural run). Removed Andrew Wang's Métro+REM+Exo paused time. Added branch specification for Métro+REM 100%. Added REM 100% category, not adding REM 100% Co-op due to present lack of community interest.</p>
